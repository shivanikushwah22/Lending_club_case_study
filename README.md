## General Information

  In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
  When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:
  **Loan accepted**: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
  Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
  Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
  Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 
  
  **Loan rejected**: The company had rejected the loan.
